            <ul>
                <li>Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art.</li>
                <li>In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life in France, where he died.</li>
                <li>They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. Read more

                <p class="p2">Vincent Van Gogh's Life Time Line</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1853 - Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands.</li>
                <li>1881 - Van Gogh's parents moved to the Etten countryside in April 1881.</li>
                <li>1883- Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands).</li>
                <li>1883 - Van Gogh relocated to Paris in March 1886, beginning a series of moves that the art historian Melissa McQuillan believes also reflects later changes "in style, his reorientation of his enterprise [which] might be linked".</li>
                <li>1886 - Ill from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles.</li>
                <li>1888 - When Gauguin agreed to visit Arles, Van Gogh hoped for friendship, and the realisation of his utopian idea of an artists' collective.</li>
                <li>1890 - Van Gogh entered the hospital at Saint Paul-de-Mausole on 8 May 1889 accompanied by his carer, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman.</li>
                <li>1890 - On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver (the gun was never found).</li>
